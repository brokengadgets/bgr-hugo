      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Checking my git logs, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on what would become mumen-controller for nearly 3 years at the time of writing this and have never stopped to record my progress in a useful way (though I have written about it in various private chat with friends and posted photos of build progress to a few group chats). For the beginning of this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on a historical recap to the best of my available records and recolection. Some details may be slightly deviated from the way things went, but it should give a useful-enough background on the project, some of the hurtles to cross, and where the current goals were generated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
