Checking my git logs, I've worked on what would become mumen-controller for nearly 3 years at the time of writing this and have never stopped to record my progress in a useful way (though I have written about it in various private chat with friends and posted photos of build progress to a few group chats). For the beginning of this post, I'll focus on a historical recap to the best of my available records and recolection. Some details may be slightly deviated from the way things went, but it should give a useful-enough background on the project, some of the hurtles to cross, and where the current goals were generated. 

### The Motivation
I'm not any good at fighting games, but I admire the dedication excellent players demonstrate. Even the casual players I have associated with take the game very seriously and using their controllers in inarguably fun. Upon looking into buying or building my own arcade pad, I was appauled at how expensive the whole process was and sought to perform a lot of the work by reporposing junk around the house. In repurposing junk, I ended up with a $5 devkit the sparkfun pro micro driven by the Atmega 32U4. I had a few in my drawer and thought I'd just make one dance as a fightstick. I ordered a joystick unit and once it arrived, I disassembled an old gaming keyboard and stuck it all into a cardboard box.
